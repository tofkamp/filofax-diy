How-to print the filofaxDIY on your printer


# Details #

Always print on 100%, do no select auto-scaling
Always print double sided (left-side)

It is good to print just the first 4 pages, to check if the output is ok on your printer.
If you keep the printer paper to the light, usual you are able to see the punch holes, with just one circle. If you see more circles, look at the printer margins.
